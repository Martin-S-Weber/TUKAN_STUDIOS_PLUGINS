Reports:

Exciter + Sub:
	- strange clicks and pops
	- Audio overload possible at preset switching

D#-Treasure (Compcact):
	- Set the ratio to 1:1 then raise the attack. When it gets to around 8 there is a volume jump and at approximately 8.5 it overloads and the channel will auto-mute.

MCP Meter:
	- switches to stereo mode (two needles) when fine adjusting



Wishes:

For all plugins
	- ‚hidden‘ features list/info available in the plugins
	- slider/envelope/midi automation - naming & functionality
	- plugins creating correct undo points
	- version history
	- oversampling
	- graphics scaling

Ideas / requests for plugins:
	- Channel strip
	- various Guitar FX

My ideas for plugins:
	- you’ll see ;)
