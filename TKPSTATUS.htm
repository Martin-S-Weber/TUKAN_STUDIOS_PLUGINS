Reports:

Peak Needle:
	- Needle prosition is wrongly scaled by changing decay time (Reported by Tukan Studios ;)

SumThing (SI):
	- check @gfx lines for correct window size
		SumThing ==> @gfx 491 300
    		SumThing SI ==> @gfx 491 450

MCP Meter:
	- switches to stereo mode (two needles) when fine adjusting

Exciter+Sub:
	- Audio overload possible at preset switching


Wishes:

Peak Needle:
	- True peak measurement
		(is in progress...you'll all be surprised by the rusults!)

For all plugins
	- ‚hidden‘ features list/info available in the plugins
	- slider/envelope/midi automation - naming & functionality
	- plugins creating correct undo points
	- version history
	- oversampling
	- graphics scaling

Ideas / requests for plugins:
	- Channel strip
	- various Guitar FX

My ideas for plugins:
	- you’ll see ;)
